The main issue in this file is missing closing brackets. Here's the fixed version with the added closing brackets:

After the line `return (250 * 5).toLocaleString();`, add:

```javascript
                            </div>
                          </div>
                        </div>
```

After `{dailyTotal.toLocaleString()}`, add:

```javascript
                                最低: {totalMinTargetRate.toFixed(1)}%
```

After `{((250 + 180 + 150) * 5).toLocaleString()}`, add:

```javascript
                    </div>
```

These additions complete the nested structure that was missing closing tags. The rest of the file appears to be properly structured.

The complete file should now be syntactically correct with all brackets and tags properly closed.
