Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```javascript
// At line 526, add missing closing bracket for getInventoryLevelStatus condition:
                                    );
                                  })}
                                </tr>
                              );
                            })}
                          </React.Fragment>
                        ))}
                      </React.Fragment>
                    ))}
                  </tbody>
                </table>
              </div>
            </div>
          </Card>
        </>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Production;
```

The main issue was in the inventory table rendering section where some closing brackets were missing from nested ternary operators and map functions. I've added the proper closing brackets to complete the component structure.

The fixed version maintains all the original functionality while ensuring proper syntax closure. The component now has balanced opening and closing brackets throughout.
