The main issue in this file is missing closing brackets. Here's the fixed version with the added closing brackets:

After the line `return (250 * 5).toLocaleString();`, add:

```javascript
                            </div>
                          </div>
                        </div>
```

After the line `{((250 + 180 + 150) * 5).toLocaleString()}`, add:

```javascript
                    </div>
```

These additions complete the nested structure that was missing its closing elements. The rest of the file appears to be properly structured.

The complete file should now be syntactically correct with all brackets properly matched and closed.
